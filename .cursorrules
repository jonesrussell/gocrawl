- Provide a brief explanation of updates made to the code.
- Use proper dependency injection for better testability.
- Maintain code readability and structure.
- Avoid global state where possible.
- Use go 1.24.
- Interface definitions:
  - Define interfaces in the package that uses them, not where they are implemented
  - For module-specific interfaces, define them in module.go
  - For interfaces used across multiple packages, define them in the consuming package
- Use the following dependencies:
	github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8
	github.com/gocolly/colly/v2
	github.com/joho/godotenv
	github.com/spf13/cobra
	go.uber.org/fx
	go.uber.org/zap

Testing
- for error assertions use require
- avoid allocations with (*os.File).WriteString
- avoid shadow declarations
- check error return values
