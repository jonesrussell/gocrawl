# Code Organization & Structure

- Split large files into smaller, focused modules.
- Keep related functionality together.
- Use consistent naming across related components.
- Avoid type stuttering in package names (e.g., use `Config` not `CollectorConfig`).
- Use descriptive variable names to avoid shadowing.
- Avoid global state where possible.
- Keep function complexity below 30 (cyclop max-complexity).
- Keep package average complexity below 10 (cyclop package-average).
- Limit function length to 100 lines or 50 statements (funlen).
- Use canonical import paths.

See [project structure guidelines](mdc:code-organization.mdc) for more details.
