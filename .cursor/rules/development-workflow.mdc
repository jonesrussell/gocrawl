# Development Workflow

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Go 1.23+ is installed
2. Clone and navigate to project directory
3. Run `go mod download` to install dependencies
4. Copy configuration examples and customize

## Common Commands
- `go build -o bin/gocrawl` - Build the application
- `go test ./...` - Run all tests
- `go mod tidy` - Clean up dependencies
- `task lint` - Run linter (golangci-lint)

## Configuration
- Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`
- Copy `sources.example.yml` to `sources.yml`
- Set up Elasticsearch connection details
- Configure logging and monitoring settings

## Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use `testify` for assertions and mocking
- Run integration tests before committing
- Ensure test coverage for critical paths

## Code Quality
- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Use `golangci-lint` for static analysis
- Follow Go coding standards
- Write clear commit messages

## Deployment
- Build for target platform
- Configure production settings
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Test in staging environment first
